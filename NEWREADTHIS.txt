My schedule just got a lot more hectic due to a major 
personal event. We are going to need to more explicitly plan
this website out. Just to clarify I really want to finish this
project. But we need a plan to build the site or at least the
wireframe. Like some kind of master plan so that we know we're
behind schedule. Also we should decide on some place where we can 
send desync messages. Whether that's fb or steam or trello, we
need some place where we know we should check messages daily.
